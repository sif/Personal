When I asked Professor Sterling if I could put up my homework, he said not to, so.. and when I asked around, I understood why. (The other professors preferred that I didn’t.) So instead, I chose to put up descriptions. All of my code are available upon request. 

I just need time and I’ll put up my own work though.
