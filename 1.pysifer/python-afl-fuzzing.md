This is how I ran the script. On macOS, do the following:
* brew install afl-fuzz
* brew install virtualenv
* sudo pip install python-afl
* SL=/System/Library; PL=com.apple.ReportCrash
* launchctl unload -w ${SL}/LaunchAgents/${PL}.plist
* sudo launchctl unload -w ${SL}/LaunchDaemons/${PL}.Root.plist

In order to use it (in my case):

    py-afl-fuzz -o ~/Desktop/results/ -i ~/Desktop/examples/ -- /usr/bin/python ~/Desktop/mylittleaflfuzzer.py

Make sure your terminal is 80x25 or bigger. To quit, hit control-c.

After you're done with everything:
* SL=/System/Library; PL=com.apple.ReportCrash
* launchctl load -w ${SL}/LaunchAgents/${PL}.plist
* sudo launchctl load -w ${SL}/LaunchDaemons/${PL}.Root.plist
